# Smart-Falcon-Hackathon
Hyperledger Fabric: A permissioned blockchain platform that is modular and scalable, suitable for various enterprise use cases.


# ABOUT:
Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain framework within the Hyperledger project that aims to provide a modular and scalable solution for developing enterprise-level blockchain applications. It is specifically designed for use in permissioned networks, where participants are known entities and have a reason to trust the network.
Key features of Hyperledger Fabric:
 1) Permissioned Network
 2) Modular Architecture
 3) Smart Contracts (Chaincode)
 4) Privacy and Confidentiality
 5) Endorsement Policies
 6) Scalability
 7) Pluggable Consensus Mechanisms

It is built by primarily using 
 1) *Ubuntu 20.04.6*:
     Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS is a stable and long-term support release of the Ubuntu operating system, providing users with a reliable and secure foundation for their computing needs.
 2) *Docker Desktop*:
    Docker Desktop is a powerful platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the intricacies of the underlying infrastructure.
 3) *Golang*:
    Go, commonly known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use. It was created by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson and first released in 2009. 


# PREREQUISITES:
# The below two lines contain the code to export the downloaded go package to the home as well as bin directories.

# PROCEDURE:
 # step 1: To setup Hyperledger Fabric Test Network
use the commands:-
 ./network.sh down
 ./network.sh up

# step 2: Package and Deploy the chain code into fabric test network 
use the command:-
 ./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccp ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go -ccl go

# step 3: Develop Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode
use the command:-
 peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" -C mychannel -n basic --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt" -c '{"function":"InitLedger","Args":[]}'

 # step 4: Test the chain code functionality using Fabric Peer CLI commands
 # 4.1: To create Asset: use the below command
   peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" -C mychannel -n basic --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt" -c '{"function":"CreateAsset","Args":["Asset5","5","24","5345","130000.6","active","0.0","","initial deposit"]}'

# 4.2: To update asset: use the below command
  peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" -C mychannel -n basic --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt" -c '{"function":"UpdateAsset","Args":["Asset5","5","24","1258","950000.6","active","0.0","","initial deposit"]}'

# 4.3: To read asset: use the below command
  peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n basic -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","Asset1"]}'

# 4.4: To get Asset Transaction History: use the below command
  peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n basic -c '{"Args":["GetAssetHistory","Asset4"]}'
